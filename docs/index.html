      <h2>How does uncut gems work?</h2>
      <p>
        Uncut gems is currently in development, we are currently collecting submissions for future listings.
        Submissions are reviewed and will be added to this site at a future date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideal projects for UncutGems are projects which  provide some benefit to end users,
        but may not be considered polished or done because they lack certain features. For example
        a web app that is 100% offline, does not save user data, but otherwise has functionality
        that users can still derive utility from could be an uncut gem.
      <p>

      <h2>How long will my listing be active?</h2>
      <p>
        The listing will be active as long as it is remains functional, and beneficial beneficial 
        to users. If the project URLs go offline, or the solution is no longer viable, then we will
        reach out to the project contact to dicuss removal.
